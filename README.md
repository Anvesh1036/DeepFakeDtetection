# Deepfake Detection using TensorFlow and Xception

This repository contains a **deepfake detection model** built using **TensorFlow** and the **Xception** architecture. The project allows for the detection of **real** vs **fake** images (deepfakes) based on the trained model.

## How to Run the Model in Google Colab

### 1. Open Google Colab
To run this project in **Google Colab**, you can either create a new notebook or directly open the notebook provided in this repository.

### 2. Install Dependencies
You will need to install the following dependencies:
- **TensorFlow**: The main library used for building and training the model.
- **Flask**: A web framework used for serving the model as an API.
- **OpenCV**: For handling video or image input processing.

Install these libraries using pip:

``bash
pip install tensorflow==2.11
pip install flask
pip install opencv-python

File Descriptions
model/:

Contains the saved trained model (model.h5). This file is used for making predictions in the Flask app.

static/:

Stores the images or videos that users upload for deepfake detection. It contains an uploads/ folder to save the uploaded files.

templates/:

Contains HTML templates used by the Flask web app.

index.html: The page where users can upload an image for prediction.

result.html: The page that displays the prediction results (whether the image is "Real" or "Fake").

app.py:

The main Flask application that serves the trained model, handles image uploads, and returns prediction results. It provides an interface for users to interact with the model via a web application.

train.py:

The script used to train the deepfake detection model. It loads the dataset, builds the Xception model, and saves the trained model to a file.

predict.py:

The script used to make predictions using the trained model. It accepts an image as input, loads the model, and outputs whether the image is real or fake.

requirements.txt:

A list of all the required Python libraries needed to run the project. You can install them using pip install -r requirements.txt.

How the Model is Trained (train.py)
The train.py script is responsible for training the deepfake detection model using the Xception architecture. Here's an explanation of how the training process works:

Loading the Dataset:

The dataset should be organized into two directories: Real and Fake, each containing corresponding images. This is necessary for supervised learning, where the model learns to differentiate between real and fake images.

Data Augmentation and Preprocessing:

The images are resized and normalized to be compatible with the Xception model.

An ImageDataGenerator is used for real-time data augmentation, which helps in improving model generalization. This includes rescaling the images and splitting them into training and validation sets.

Model Architecture:

The Xception model is used for transfer learning. The pre-trained weights from ImageNet are used, and the top layer is removed to modify the model for binary classification (real vs fake).

A GlobalAveragePooling2D layer is added to reduce the spatial dimensions of the output.

A Dense layer with a sigmoid activation is used for binary classification (output 0 for Real and 1 for Fake).

Model Compilation:

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.

Training the Model:

The model is trained using the train_generator (which loads the training data) and validation_generator (which loads the validation data).

The training process runs for a set number of epochs, adjusting the model weights to minimize the loss.

Saving the Trained Model:

After training, the model is saved as model.h5 in the model/ directory. This file contains the architecture, weights, and learned parameters.

Here’s a high-level overview of the code inside train.py:

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import Xception
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Prepare image generators
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255, validation_split=0.2)
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    'data/', target_size=(299, 299), batch_size=32, class_mode='binary', subset='training')
validation_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    'data/', target_size=(299, 299), batch_size=32, class_mode='binary', subset='validation')

# Build Xception model
base_model = Xception(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)
model = Sequential([
    base_model,
    GlobalAveragePooling2D(),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Binary classification: Real or Fake
])

# Compile model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train model
model.fit(train_generator, epochs=10, validation_data=validation_generator)

# Save the model
model.save('model/model.h5')
After running train.py, the trained model will be saved as model.h5, and you can then use this file to make predictions on new data.

Next Steps and Customizations
Multi-class Classification: The model can be extended to classify more than just two classes (e.g., real, fake, unknown).

Video Prediction: You can add functionality to upload and process videos by extracting frames and running predictions on them.

Model Improvements: Implement techniques like data augmentation to improve the accuracy of the model.
